# Loop Task Loops

A Loop is a **cadence** — a recurring schedule that decides when an iteration starts. It decides _when_; its initial Task decides _what_. One Loop runs one iteration at a time, never overlapping.

## Pre-Design Questionnaire

Before designing a Loop, use the **question** tool to ask the user about their tooling. Present all questions as a single form:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What issue/ticket system do you use?",
    "header": "Tracker",
    "options": [
      { "label": "GitHub Issues (gh)", "description": "Use gh CLI for issue and PR management." },
      { "label": "Azure DevOps (az)", "description": "Use az CLI for work-item and PR management." },
      { "label": "Jira (custom)", "description": "Use a custom script or API wrapper for Jira." },
      { "label": "Other", "description": "Specify the tool." }
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "What AI runner do you use for AI Tasks?",
    "header": "AI Runner",
    "options": [
      { "label": "opencode run", "description": "Use opencode for AI agent execution." },
      { "label": "claude -p", "description": "Use Claude CLI for AI execution." },
      { "label": "aider", "description": "Use aider for AI-assisted coding." },
      { "label": "Other", "description": "Specify the runner." }
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "What operating system, shell, and package manager will run these Tasks?",
    "header": "Runtime",
    "options": [
      { "label": "Windows + PowerShell", "description": "Prefer Node-based helpers and Windows-safe commands." },
      { "label": "macOS/Linux + POSIX shell", "description": "POSIX shell commands are available." },
      { "label": "Mixed environments", "description": "Use portable Node helpers where possible." },
      { "label": "Other", "description": "Specify the environment." }
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "What label lifecycle do you use?",
    "header": "Labels",
    "options": [
      { "label": "pick to pr to done", "description": "Standard lifecycle with a PR stage." },
      { "label": "pick to done", "description": "Simple lifecycle without a PR stage." },
      { "label": "Custom", "description": "Specify the label transitions." }
    ]
  },
  {
    "question": "How important is consuming fewer tokens?",
    "header": "Tokens",
    "options": [
      { "label": "Critical", "description": "Break everything into small concrete CLI tasks. Minimise AI usage." },
      { "label": "Moderate", "description": "Mix concrete CLI tasks with AI tasks. Use AI for judgment work only." },
      { "label": "Low", "description": "One big AI task is acceptable. The AI can handle searching and processing." }
    ]
  }
]
```

Wait for ALL answers before proceeding. Use the answers to select the executable syntax and chain composition. No model or agent flags should be hardcoded in Task definitions — those are runtime concerns.

For interface-specific syntax vocabulary to compose concrete tasks from the questionnaire answers, see [references/recipes.md](references/recipes.md).

## What a Loop Owns

| Property | Meaning |
|---|---|
| cadence (interval) | How often iterations become eligible |
| initial Task (taskId) | First Task of each iteration, or null for inline payload |
| Project membership (projectId) | Which Project scopes this Loop |
| immediate | Whether the first iteration runs without waiting |
| maxRuns | Optional limit on total iterations |
| working directory (cwd) | Where executable payloads run |
| initial context | Key-value pairs seeded into every iteration |
| offset | Overrides the computed phase for spread scheduling |

For every property including runtime state, see [references/domain-reference.md](references/domain-reference.md).

## Cadence

Cadence is the interval at which a Loop becomes eligible to start a new iteration. Supported units: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks.

**First iteration**: `immediate = true` starts right away. `immediate = false` waits for a computed phase delay that distributes Loops across their interval.

**Next iteration**: scheduled relative to the _start_ of the current iteration, not its end. If an iteration overruns the cadence, missed points are **skipped** (counted, not queued).

**Manual-only** (cadence = 0): the Loop never auto-schedules. Each iteration must be triggered explicitly. After each trigger, the Loop returns to idle.

See [references/lifecycle.md](references/lifecycle.md) for the full state-transition diagram and restoration semantics.

## Iteration Lifecycle

1. Loop becomes eligible (cadence point or manual trigger).
2. `runCount` increments by one. The full chain counts as one iteration.
3. Fresh context is created: seeded from `task.context` + `loop.context` (Loop overrides Task for same keys).
4. Initial Task (or inline payload) executes.
5. Chain continues sequentially via `onSuccess`/`onFailure`.
6. Context accumulates across the chain (stdout parsed and merged at each step).
7. Chain terminates when no successor matches the result.
8. Iteration recorded in run history.
9. `maxRuns` rechecked; next cadence point calculated.

## State Model

| State | Scheduling | Running Task |
|---|---|---|
| running | Inapplicable | Active |
| waiting | Counting down | None |
| paused | Suspended (preserves remaining delay) | None |
| idle | Cleared | None |

Key transitions: running → waiting (execution completes), running → paused (pause), waiting → running (delay or trigger), paused → waiting (resume, continues remaining delay), idle → waiting (play, fresh schedule), any active → idle (stop, clears schedule).

After reaching `maxRuns`, the Loop enters **paused**. There is no "completed" state — `maxRunsReached` distinguishes paused-by-limit from paused-by-user.

## Non-overlap

A Loop will not start another iteration while one is executing. Separate Loops run independently and concurrently. Tasks within one chain execute sequentially.

Non-overlap does not make side effects safe — two separate Loops modifying the same resource can still interfere. Design Tasks to be idempotent.

## Multi-Loop Pipelines

Loops can form a **pipeline** through shared external state markers (labels, tags). One Loop's finalization produces work the next Loop's selection consumes. Each Loop keeps its own cadence, chain, and context — they coordinate at the label boundary, never directly.

This is how production lines work: a refine Loop produces ready items, an implement Loop consumes them, both running at different cadences.

For label state machines, selection-reservation patterns, and state-aware recovery, see [references/playbooks.md](references/playbooks.md).

For interface-specific syntax vocabulary for composing concrete loops and multi-loop pipelines, see [references/recipes.md](references/recipes.md).

## Maximum Iterations

`maxRuns` is optional — null means unlimited. Each full iteration (including all chain Tasks) counts as one. Failed iterations count. After reaching `maxRuns`, the Loop pauses. Clearing the flag resets the count and allows play again.

## Antipatterns

- Intervals shorter than normal execution time (guarantees skipped cadence points).
- Assuming missed intervals queue (they are skipped).
- Relying on overlapping execution within one Loop (never happens).
- Non-idempotent repeated effects (Tasks that create resources must handle "already exists").
- Using failure for ordinary no-work states (use success with no `onSuccess` — see `loop-task-tasks`).
- Assuming context persists between iterations (discarded each time).
- Accidental cycles in Task chains (Loop Task does not validate against them).
- One Loop for unrelated objectives (use separate Loops).
