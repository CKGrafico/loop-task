# Context Lifecycle Reference

## Overview

The iteration context is a key-value map (`Record<string, unknown>`) that carries data between Tasks within a single iteration. Created fresh each iteration, extended by Task stdout, discarded when the iteration completes.

## 1. Creation

A new, empty context is created at the start of each iteration, before the first Task executes.

## 2. Initial Seeding

```
chainContext = { ...task.context, ...loop.context }
```

Loop context overrides Task context for the same key. Shallow merge via spread operator. When neither provides context, starts empty (`{}`).

### Validation

Initial context values must be primitives: strings, numbers, booleans, or null. Nested objects and arrays are rejected by the validation function at creation time.

## 3. Stdout Capture

Stdout is captured only when at least one of these conditions is true:
- The Task has chain successors (`onSuccessTaskId` or `onFailureTaskId` is defined)
- The Task has multiple steps
- The first step has multiple commands

When stdout is **not** captured, it is streamed directly to the log file. No context parsing occurs.

### Capture mechanism

- Captured via a transform stream that accumulates bytes.
- Capped at **1 MB** (`MAX_CONTEXT_STDOUT_BYTES = 1048576`).
- If exceeded, truncated. A warning is written to the log, but the captured portion is still parsed.
- Stderr is **never** captured for context. Written to the log file only.

## 4. Parsing Rules

### Step 1: Trim

Leading/trailing whitespace removed.

### Step 2: Empty check

If trimmed output is empty, no context change occurs. Parser returns `null`.

### Step 3: Whole-output JSON parse attempt

If `JSON.parse` succeeds:

| Parsed result | Context update |
|---|---|
| JSON object | Keys merged directly into the context |
| JSON string primitive | `{ output: String(value) }` |
| JSON number primitive | `{ output: "42" }` (converted to string) |
| JSON boolean primitive | `{ output: "true" }` (converted to string) |
| JSON null | `{ output: "null" }` |
| JSON array | `{ output: originalString }` (stored as raw string) |

### Step 4: JSONL parse attempt (when whole-output parse fails)

Output split into lines. Each non-empty line parsed as JSON:

- If ALL non-empty lines parse successfully:
  - Object line keys merged into context.
  - Primitive line stored under `output` key.
  - Example: `{"a":1}\n{"b":2}` → `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`

- If ANY line fails: fall through to plain text.

### Step 5: Plain text fallback

Any output that is not valid JSON or JSONL is stored under the `output` key:

- `{ output: trimmedString }`
- Multi-line plain text preserves internal newlines.

## 5. Merge Semantics

Parsed output is merged via `Object.assign(chainContext, parsed)`.

| Merge rule | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| New key | Added to the context |
| Existing key | Overwritten (shallow replacement) |
| The `output` key | Overwritten every time a Task produces plain-text output |
| Structured keys (from JSON) | Each key added or overwritten individually |
| No deep merge | Nested objects replaced at the top level |

### Key clobbering

A Task producing plain text **always** overwrites the `output` key. To preserve values across chain steps, use **named JSON keys**.

In JSONL output, later lines overwrite earlier lines for the same key.

## 6. Interpolation

`{{key}}` placeholders in command and arguments are replaced with context values before every Task executes.

### Syntax

`{{key}}` where `key` matches `\w+` (one or more word characters).

### Behaviour

| Context state | Result |
|---|---|
| String value | Shell-escaped and inserted |
| Number value | `String(value)`, shell-escaped |
| Boolean value | `"true"` or `"false"` inserted |
| Null | Empty string |
| Key does not exist | Empty string (no error) |

### Shell escaping

- Safe characters (letters, digits, `_-=:./,@`) pass through unmodified.
- Everything else wrapped in single quotes with internal single quotes escaped.

### What interpolation does not do

- Does not modify the context (original values remain).
- Does not support nested `{{outer.{inner}}}` syntax.
- Does not support default values or conditional expressions.

## 7. Context Lifetime

| Boundary | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Between Tasks in the same chain | Context persists and accumulates |
| Across success/failure transitions | Context persists |
| Between iterations | Context is **discarded** |
| Between Loops | Context is **not shared** |
| On persistence | Context is **never persisted** |

## 8. Edge Cases

| Edge case | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Task produces no output | No context change |
| Task produces only whitespace | No context change |
| Invalid JSON that looks like JSONL | JSONL detection fails → plain text under `output` |
| Two Tasks produce the same named key | Later value overwrites earlier |
| Task produces a JSON array | Stored as raw string under `output` |
| Task produces a JSON primitive | Converted to string under `output` |
| Context value contains special characters | Shell-escaped during interpolation |
| Context value contains newlines | Preserved in context; shell-escaped during interpolation |
| Context key contains non-word characters | Not matchable by `{{key}}` |
| Task with no successors produces stdout | Not captured; goes to log only |
| Multi-step: JSON then plain text | JSON keys merged, then `output` overwritten |
